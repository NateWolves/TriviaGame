# TriviaGame
A web browser animal trivia game. This trivia game pulls its questions from the TriviaAPI and displays these questions to the user. This site uses the javascript method of setInterval() to restrict the users time on each question. At the end of each round the user can play again and the game calls the API for another set of questions.
